penify
What is penify
This project is made by me for my portfolio project at the end of their foundation year at Alx School. It was designed to be the ultimate portfolio project: I used Django framework to build the backend web application, MySQL to store client data, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend; and deploying the web application in containers, using Kubernetes to manage the clusters, Puppet manifests to configure the containers, and PHP.
What penify does
When you have any non-pen (penn't) content to share with a "only allowed to say pen" community, like a funny story or joke, sharing it just as it is will result in you getting removed from the community! That is where penify swoops in to save the day, by helping you turn all of your words into "pen"! Now your story or joke or whatever is safe to share. A link is also provided, for friends who are in these communities but do not speak fluent pen, to view the original input. As a bonus, any digit in the input is replaced by "0" to make the output more pen-like.
About me

Hi, my name is Victor and I like chess, writing, puns, and word games. I started studying at Alx School and realized that I enjoy coding and how much I like pens. I like them so much that I founded the public pen channel in our school Slack! Somewhere along the way I discovered there are corners of the internet where you are only allowed to say the word “pen” and other variations of it, and the idea for penify was born. I wanted to make a web app that incorporated my love of pen and the concepts I learned at school. I am looking for a backend developer position so hire me please!

How it works
back end and front end:
1.     User visits penify site
2.     User inputs text
3.     User clicks “penify” button, which sends POST request


4.     New object is created from user input and saved into database
5.     User input is penified to specified language
6.     Penified output sent to front end and displayed
7.     Object id is sent to front end and appended to hostname and url


8.     User can use top button to copy penified out put to share with pen community, and use the bottom button to copy link to original input to share along with penified output
9.     Someone not fluent in pen visits link to someone's original input
